Platform game engine in the style of Jet Set Willy - SFML framework for rendering but game engine written from scratch.
<p>
<b> 28/03/2021 </b> - Forgot about this! Not working on it anymore spend most of my time working in Unreal. Feel free to use if you can make sense of any of it.
<p>
<b> 22/01/2018 </b> - Added some new screenshots of the game and editor
<p> 
<b> 19/12/2018 </b> - Restarted work on this. Will be concentrating on editor improvements. I'll be moving away from a remake and make this an original game in the style of Jet Set Willy
<p>
<b>NOTE 10/09/2018</b> - project isn't dead. I've taken a break over summer as I'm working on a CS Course
<p>
