Remake of a Spectrum platform game - Lets call it Jet Set Billy - SFML framework for rendering but game engine written from scratch
<p>
Going to remake this hopefully with a level editor. Used to enjoy this as a child so thought it would be fun to re-make it
currently very early days...
<p>
Currently supports: <br>
* Collision detection for walls, enemies and collectables <br>
* Loading of levels from external file in custom file format (needed for an editor!) <br>
* Textures loaded externally and applied based on the file format <br>
* Spritesheets (currently a bit hacky and restricted) <br>
<p>
<p>
Current TODO: <p>
* <del>Platforms which can be jumped through from the underside and walked on</del> done <br>
* Stairs <br>
* Loading multiple rooms <br>
* Ropes <br>
* Sound support <br>
* Refactoring main into a game manager <br>
* Gameplay logic, e.g. amount of collectables, lives etc. <br>
* Level Editor - likely written in c# <p>
