Remake of a Spectrum platform game - Lets call it Jet Set Billy - SFML framework for rendering but game engine written from scratch

Going to remake this hopefully with a level editor. Used to enjoy this as a child so thought it would be fun to re-make it
currently very early days...

Currently supports:
Collision detection for walls, enemies and collectables 
Loading of levels from external file in custom file format (needed for an editor!)
Textures loaded externally and applied based on the file format
Spritesheets (currently a bit hacky and restricted)

Current TODO:
Platforms which can be jumped through from the underside and walked on
Stairs
Loading multiple rooms
Ropes
Sound support
Refactoring main into a game manager
Gameplay logic, e.g. amount of collectables, lives etc.
Level Editor - likely written in c#

added first screenshot. Not much to see. The blue circles represent enemies
